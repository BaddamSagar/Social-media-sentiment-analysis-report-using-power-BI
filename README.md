# INTRODUCTION:

In today's digital age, social media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and brand perception. This project presents a comprehensive Social Media Sentiment Analysis Dashboard created using Power BI. The dashboard analyzes the sentiment of social media posts, providing insights into public mood and opinion trends. By transforming raw social media data into meaningful visual insights, the dashboard helps in tracking sentiment over time, identifying key discussion topics, and understanding the factors driving positive or negative sentiments.

# DATA SOURCE:

The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle, which includes social media posts along with their sentiment scores. The data covers a specific time period and includes various attributes such as post content, date, time, user details, and sentiment scores.

# DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION:

The raw dataset required several cleaning and preparation steps to ensure accuracy and readiness for analysis:

Handling Missing Values: Identified and addressed missing values by either imputing them or removing incomplete records.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Ensured all columns had the correct data types (e.g., dates as date types, text as strings).
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaned the text data by removing special characters, stop words, and performing tokenization.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assign sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) to each post.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features such as sentiment score averages, post frequency, and engagement metrics.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregated data at different levels (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) for varied analytical perspectives.

# INSIGHTS AND FINDINGS:

- **Overall Sentiment**: The analysis shows a predominantly positive sentiment towards the brand/product, with occasional spikes in negative sentiment due to specific events or issues.
- **Sentiment Trends**: There are noticeable trends in sentiment over time, with peaks during major events or product launches.
- **Key Influencers**: Certain users consistently contribute high-engagement posts, indicating their significant influence on public opinion.
- **Popular Topics**: Key themes identified include customer service, product features, and brand reputation, with varying sentiment scores.
- **Geographical Insights**: Sentiment varies by location, with certain regions showing higher positive sentiment, possibly due to localized campaigns or events.


# CONCLUSION:

The Social Media Sentiment Analysis Dashboard provides valuable insights into public opinion and sentiment trends across social media platforms. By leveraging data visualization in Power BI, the dashboard transforms raw social media data into actionable insights, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and tailor their strategies accordingly. Future improvements could include real-time sentiment analysis and incorporating data from additional social media platforms to provide a more comprehensive view.
